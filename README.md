# Portfolio / Blog built with Next.JS

It's an updated version of my portfolio site on [www.taryn.codes](www.taryn.codes) but built in Next.JS.

The previous version used a headless Wordpress CMS, with a Gatsby front-end, but inspired by the [Next.JS 'learn' tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app), I wanted to try to rebuild it in Next.JS and use markdown for the blog posts rather than a CMS.

It's also my first adventure into CSS modules!
