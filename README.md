# Portfolio / Blog built with Next.JS

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/6b3fac52-74d7-402e-98ee-b4b92cde439e/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/taryn-codes-production/deploys)

It's an updated version of my portfolio site on [www.tarynewens.com](https://www.tarynewens.com) but built in Next.JS.

The previous version used a headless Wordpress CMS, with a Gatsby front-end, but inspired by the [Next.JS 'learn' tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app), I wanted to try to rebuild it in Next.JS and use markdown for the blog posts rather than a CMS.

It's also my first adventure into CSS modules!

## How to develop
- `yarn install` to install packages
- `yarn build` to build the site
- `yarn start` to serve a production version of the site to localhost
- `yarn dev` to serve a development version of the site to localhost with hot reloading
